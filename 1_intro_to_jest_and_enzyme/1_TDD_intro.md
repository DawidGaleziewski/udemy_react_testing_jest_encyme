# test driven development

Flow:
1. Write "shell function that does not do anything
2. Write tests bedore writing code
3. Test fails

this is red-green testing. We want our tests to fail!

4. Write code!

Why we use TDD?
- more efficient then manual testing
- we re-run the tests for 'free'
- better code - we have to plan before we code
- code is more testable as we writte it with testing in mind. We wont have to refactor code to be tested
- Fewer bugs. Bugs will be catched earlier. Regression tests
- Great code coverage
